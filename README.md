The first idea we propose is a FoodWebSite oriented to help the user to chose the best option for him/her 
showing not only the available places near his/her location using an API from Google Maps. The web site also 
will allow user to interct with the database so the website will show to the user aditional information obtained 
from the database NYC_restaurants like the grade granted, date when receive the certification and exact address.
To run the first part just run the index.html from Visual Studio or type it in the web browser.
